###A sewage tank/pipe cleaner###

(This is for the hardware project)

Designing and creating a solid waste pile pickup and clearing rover in sewage treatment units. This works underwater and helps avoid over-clogging of the tanks. It follows a certain path that can be set based on the information gathered when the rover maps and detects its surroundings. The path can be set using deep learning. Sensors will be used to detect its surroundings.

(For a simulation)

This project focuses on the simulation of a sewage solid waste cleaning rover. In the project we will simulate a virtual environment similar to a sewage treatment unit. The rover will be made to navigate and operate in an underwater type simulation. After mapping, it follows a predetermined path based on the data processed after mapping and detects and clears the wastes based on the sensor data. 

####The Setup####

**_Hardware_**(tentative)

*Radar* - A radar can help in detection of distances across disturbances in the sewage waters, and can help in the detection of the solids.

*ultrasonic sensor* - This helps in measuring the solid level measurement. Ultrasonic sensors can calculate the angle of repose and detect the height of the pile. This cannot be measured over longer distances though, since ultrasound waves are absorbed by impurities and foam and waves. It works along with the radar to gather the required input.

**_IoT_**

Using Node Red, we can connect the hardware and collect the data remotely.
